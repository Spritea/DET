### About DET
Lane extraction is a basic yet necessary task for autonomous driving. Although past years have witnessed major advances in lane extraction with deep learning models, they all aim at ordinary RGB images generated by framebased cameras, which limits their performance in nature. To tackle this problem, we introduce Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS), a type of event-based sensor to lane extraction
task and build a high-resolution DVS dataset for lane extraction (DET). We collect the raw event data and generate 5,424 event-based sensor images with a resolution of 1280x800, **the highest one among all DVS datasets available now.** These images include complex traffic scenes and various lane types. All images of DET are annotated with multi-class segmentation format. The fully annotated DET
images contains 17,103 lane instances, each of which is labeled pixel by pixel manually. We evaluate state-of-the-art lane extraction models on DET to build a benchmark for lane extraction task with event-based sensor images. Experimental results demonstrate that DET is quite challenging for even state-of-the-art lane extraction methods. **DET
is made publicly available, including the raw event data, accumulated images and labels.** 

### DET Components

DET consists of the raw event data, accumulated images over 30ms and corresponding lane labels.
